Since this package is based on the `ICOtronic package`_, the requirement for using the ICOtest package are `pretty much the same as for ICOtronic package <https://mytoolit.github.io/ICOtronic/#requirements>`__.

.. _ICOtronic package: https://icotronic.readthedocs.io

In addition, **some tests** also assume:

- that you connected a programming board to the hardware, and
- installed either :ref:`Simplicity Commander or Simplicity Studio <simplicity>`. For more information, please take a look at the section :ref:`Configuration <configuration>`.
