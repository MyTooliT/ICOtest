Running Tests
*************

.. _pytest: https://pytest.org

The test for the ICOtronic hardware are based on `pytest`_. To execute all the tests for the hardware you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pytest --pyargs icotest.test

after you :ref:`installed <install>` the package. We also provide a CLI tool that more or less acts as a alias for the command above:

.. code-block:: shell

   icotest run

To list all available test use the option ``--co`` or ``--collect-only``:

.. code-block:: shell

   icotest run --collect-only

To execute a specific text you can use the option ``-k``, which expects `an expression as argument <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html#using-k-expr-to-select-tests-based-on-their-name>`__. For example, let us assume that the collection command command above produced the following output:

.. code-block:: text

   <Module test_sensor_node.py>
     Test power usage of ICOtronic hardware
     <Coroutine test_connection>
       Test if connection to sensor node is possible
     <Coroutine test_supply_voltage>
       Test if battery voltage is within expected bounds
     <Coroutine test_power_usage_streaming>
       Test power usage of sensor node while streaming

In this case we can execute all of the tests of the module ``test_sensor_node.py`` using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   icotest run -k test_sensor_node

To execute only a single test just add an ``and`` followed by the test name to the command. For example, to only execute the test ``test_supply_voltage`` of the module ``test_sensor_node.py`` use the command:

.. code-block:: shell

   icotest run -k "test_sensor_node.py and test_supply_voltage"

Another option to execute the same test would be the command:

.. code-block:: shell

   icotest run icotest.test.test_sensor_node::test_supply_voltage

For more information on how to execute specific tests, please take a look at the `pytest documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests>`__.

Debugging Tests
===============

Sometimes you want to get additional information about test execution. For that purpose you can increase the logging level. For example, to output info logging messages (in addition to the warning and error logging messages enabled by default) you can use the ``icotest`` option ``--log`` with the argument ``info``:

.. code-block:: shell

   icotest --log info run

The ``--log`` option supports the `standard log levels <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels>`__:

- ``debug``
- ``info``
- ``warning``
- ``error``
- ``critical``
